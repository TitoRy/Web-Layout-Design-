<h2>APO Hikings Society</h2>
<p></p>The name "Apolinario Mabini Hiking Society" was meant to be deliberately ironic since the historical figure, Apolinario Mabini, famously lost the use of his legs to polio.
<br/><br/>The APO Hiking Society first gained recognition in 1973 when they gave a farewell concert at the Meralco Theater in Pasig, Metro Manila, Philippines. Just out of college, the group was the talk of the Ateneo de Manila University and adjoining campuses for their music and humor.
<br/><br/>It was only when two of its four members were about to retire from the field of amateur music, however, that APO Hiking Society, then known as the Apolinario Mabini Hiking Society, finally had a citywide audience. One of them was scheduled to leave for Turkey as an exchange student. The other had a position waiting for him in his father's advertising firm.
<br/><br/>The trip to Turkey did not materialize and APO, now a tentative trio, pushed on steadily towards fame and fortune.
<br/><br/> APO has 4 members:
    <li> Ely Buendia – lead vocals, rhythm guitar
    <br/><br/><li> Danny Javier (†) - lead vocals, composer
    <br/><br/><li> Jim Paredes - vocals, composer
    <br/><br/><li> Boboy Garrovillo - vocals, composer </li>
